// Type declarations for monorepo module resolution issues
// This file helps TypeScript resolve modules correctly in the Turborepo + Bun setup

// The expo-router typed routes are generated automatically.
// Routes that don't exist yet will show type errors but will work at runtime.
// Add new routes to app/ directory to automatically add them to the typed route system.

// If you see route errors, run: npx expo customize tsconfig.json
// and make sure .expo/types directory is included
